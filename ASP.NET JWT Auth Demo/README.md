# ASP.NET JWT Auth Demo

Still a work in progress - a full stack app which I used to learn more about Blazor/Razor pages and JWT Authentication/Authorization in .NET

## This repo contains the following projects:

## ASP.NET Server
A Server which only contains functionality for Login and Authentication

## Blazor Client
A front end app which is built on Razor Pages which allows the user to log in and fetch data.
